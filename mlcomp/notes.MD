# My goals
1. Learn how to accelerate models using CUDA and Cutlass

# My hero's journy
Understanding Parallelism: We'll start with the basics of parallel computing and why GPUs are great for this.

Installing CUDA: Next, we'll set up your development environment by installing CUDA Toolkit.

Hello World: We'll write a simple 'Hello World' CUDA program to get a feel for the syntax.

Memory Management: You'll learn about memory allocation and data transfers on the GPU.

Thread Organization: Dive deep into thread hierarchy and how to manage threads efficiently.

Kernel Functions: You'll create and launch kernel functions, the heart of CUDA programming.

Optimization: Discover how to optimize your code for maximum GPU performance.

Real-world Applications: We'll tackle practical projects to apply what you've learned.

Debugging: Learn how to troubleshoot CUDA programs effectively.

Advanced Topics: Explore advanced topics like libraries, multi-GPU programming, and cuBLAS.
